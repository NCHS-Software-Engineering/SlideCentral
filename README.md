# Welcome to SlideCentral!

Hi! This is the app SlideCentral, developed by a group of students for Dr. Miller's Software Engineering class. This app aims to provide an easier solution for students and teachers alike to view school activities, and for club sponsors to upload their upcoming activities to garner a larger amount of participation. 

SlideCentral is hosted on a website coded in ReactJS, and uses SQL to store all of its user information. Any desktop operating system will be fine, as long as it has a browser. 


# Instructions to run
1. To start off, go into terminal and cd into the folder "my-app"
2. Next, run the command `npm start` to start the website, and in a different
	terminal, run `node server.js` to start the local server.
3. If any problems occur, run `npm install` to install any necessary dependencies

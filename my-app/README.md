# Brief Overview of the Project

Hello! This is the app called SlideCentral, developed by a group of students for Dr. Miller's Software Engineering class. This app aims to provide an easier solution for students and teachers alike to view school activities, and for club sponsors to upload their upcoming activities to garner a larger amount of participation. 

# Platform Requirements
SlideCentral is hosted on a website coded in ReactJS, and uses SQL to store all of its user information. Any desktop operating system will be fine, as long as it has a browser. This app is not designed to be used for mobile devices.


# Sequential Installation Instructions
1. To start off, go into terminal and cd into the folder "my-app"
2. Next, run the command `npm start` to start the website, and in a different
	terminal, run `npm server.js` to start the local server.
3. If any problems occur, run `npm install` to install any necessary dependencies
